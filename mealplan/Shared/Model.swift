Don't stir it, but wait until it starts to melt, turning dark golden here and there. When most of the sugar is melted, gently swirl to incorporate any dry patches. Stir in 25g of the coconut butter. Toss the pear slices in the remaining cinnamon, then add to the caramel and cook for 5 mins until softened. Set aside.",

Remove to a plate and keep warm in the oven. Continue frying the fritters, adding more coconut butter as needed. Serve the fritters topped with a spoonful of coconut yogurt followed by the warm pears."
